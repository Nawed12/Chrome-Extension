## What's a Chrome Extension?
On a basic level, an extension is just a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript snippets that lets us execute some extra functionalities through the JavaScript APIs that the Chrome browser exposes. In layman's terms, an extension is mostly a webpage hosted inside Chrome with access to some specific APIs.
